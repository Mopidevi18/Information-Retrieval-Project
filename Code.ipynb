      "By head coach Mike Roeder's count, his Northeastern Knights football team has had its full starting lineup for two quarters this entire season. \n",
      "Ryan Hartmann and Josh Tudor started the season as the Knights' top running backs. \n",
      "Tudor was out for the season after Week 4. Hartmann is out after Week 7. Others have played through injury, but the Knights still completed a second straight 7-0 run through Tri-Eastern Conference play. \n",
      "\"That's a tough stat,\" Roeder said of the lineup,\" but when you can say you're 7-0 and ran the whole conference schedule like that, I think it once again, big tribute to the guys, the defense. Words just really can't describe how proud we are.\" \n",
      "Somehow, the Knights still managed to win week in and week out, improving their TEC win streak to 17 straight games with Friday's 40-0 shutout victory over Union City. \n",
      "\"It's almost like we've been putting in a new lineup every game,\" said Roeder, who has 96 wins in his 19-year head coaching career. \"It takes a little while to get used to each other, so I think the one constant year after year has been the line, and the line play is what won it on both sides.\" \n",
      "The line play for the Knights has been the most experienced, but the defense has been key, too, as they have posted back-to-back shutout victories. \n",
      "Northeastern's defense has allowed 7 points per TEC game, less than last year's 10.9. \n",
      "The defense has helped make up for the loss of offense that graduated and left behind so many questions. \n",
      "\"Dakota Green is a rock on both sides (of the line) and Austin McNew plays offensive line, Chace Mosley, who's pretty impressive on both sides, (Friday) we had a freshman starting on one guard and a kid who had never played tackle played tackle,\" Roeder said. \"I just feel like I put a new lineup out there, we glue things together, so the tribute here is that despite all that, they're still finding ways to win. This is a team we say we'll always remember because of their heart. This is a heart team, this is a team that never gave up, we're just delighted in the way that the season went for them.\" \n",
      "Friday's win also puts the Knights in elite company, as they are only the third team ever to win three straight TEC football championships, after sharing it with Winchester in 2013 and winning outright the last two seasons. \n",
      "Hagerstown won three straight from 1980-82 and Winchester shared the title with Hagerstown and Union County in 1986, before winning three straight from 1987-89. \n",
      "\"We're part of history and we're proud of that,\" Roeder said. \n",

      "PredictionMachine.com’s Director of Research and Analytics, John Ewing, takes a look at what the College Football Playoffs could look like through 50,000 simulations of Football Four’s most likely four-team playoff. Follow John on Twitter @JohnEwing for more notes from his analysis and to let him know what else you may like to see with these projections.\n",
      "How this works The Predictalator uses current rosters and strength-of-schedule and efficiency-adjusted team and player stats (weighted slightly more toward recent games), to play every game 50,000 times before it's actually played. For this analysis, we are tracking how likely a team is to make it to any level of the College Football Playoff.\n",
      "Football Four Playoff Summary What if Oregon isn’t good?\n",
      "The Ducks have been one of the elite teams in the country over the last half decade, but a 42-point loss at home to Utah is cause for concern. Last year’s runner-up doesn’t play defense. Anyone can score on Oregon. The defense has yielded 40.8 points per game (117th in nation), and the offense is struggling, relative to past performance.\n",
      "The Ducks do not have a championship-caliber team (29th in our Power Rankings ), and the wins banked by Michigan State and Utah should be weighted accordingly. The Spartans and Utes are currently in the four-team Playoff , but neither should get too comfortable.\n",
      "Ohio State has already jumped Michigan State for the top seed in the Football Four panel's Playoff Projection. The Buckeyes square off against Utah in the first semifinal. The Utes are good, and their win against Oregon was one of the top story lines of Week 4 in college football, but against a true playoff team like the Buckeyes, Utah will be exposed.\n",
      "Follow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. Urban Meyer’s team is incredibly balanced. The Buckeyes have a top 20 offense and perhaps the best defense (allowing 8.3 points per game) in the country led by the potential first pick in next year’s NFL draft. Utah would lose to Ohio State 82.1% percent of the time by an average projected score of 30-20.\n",
      "Who will face the Buckeyes in the championship game?\n",
      "Ole Miss didn’t have its A-game in a shaky win against Vanderbilt last week. The hangover after an emotional win against Alabama almost cost the Rebels their seat at the table. A focused Mississippi team is dangerous, and that is the squad Michigan State faces in the second semifinal.\n",
      "The Spartans have been outgained in terms of total yards in three consecutive games. Michigan State is outside the top 10 in our Power Rankings . Against the best team from the SEC, the Spartans get rolled. Ole Miss wins 89.6% of the time with an average projected score of 37-23.\n",
      "It’s Ohio State against Mississippi for the title. Ohio State’s offense hasn’t found its rhythm and Ole Miss ranks in the top 12 in every offensive and defensive efficiency category, the only team in the nation that can make that claim.\n",
      "After 50,000 simulations, the most likely national champion is the Mississippi. Mississippi wins 56.8% of all the simulated tournaments. In the most likely national championship game, Ole Miss defeats Ohio State 59.3% of the time by an average score of 29-27.\n",
      "Laquon Treadwell (1) and Mississippi project as the College Football Playoff winner in new simulations. (Photo: Rogelio V. Solis, AP)\n",
      "Based on the analysis, here is the projected College Football Playoff bracket:\n",
      "Semifinals No. 1 seed Ohio State vs. No. 4 seed Utah\n",
      "Ohio State wins 82.1% of the time by an average score of 30-20.\n",
      "No. 2 seed Michigan State vs. No. 3 seed Mississippi\n",
      "Ole Miss wins 89.6% of the time by an average score of 37-23.\n",
      "National Championship No. 1 seed Ohio State vs. No. 3 seed Mississippi\n",
      "Ole Miss wins 59.3% of the time by an average score of 29-27.\n",
      "Odds for each team to advance to and win the championship: Ohio State 38.3%; Utah 3.2%; Michigan State 1.7%; Mississippi 56.8%.\n",

      "MILFORD — Before Foran rolled to a 53-28 win over onetime state power New London on Friday night, before the Lions improved to 5-0, they needed to stop one big Whalers play. \n",
      "It was one the Lions had seen on film, and it was one Steve Lynch read perfectly to intercept Melquann Gomez and short-circuit the Whalers' eight-play opening drive. \n",
      "\"We were in Cover 3. I dropped back,\" Lynch said. \"Reading the routes, the guy ran a slant. It was a little overthrown, I came up on it, and I grabbed it.\" \n",
      "The Lions took the turnover 65 yards in 10 plays and scored. They scored on their next four possessions, too, to take a 33-0 lead. It was 53-6 when the first team left the game.. \n",
      "\"That (interception) turned the whole pages around, and we went on that long drive,\" Foran coach Jeff Bevino said. \n",
      "\"We knew that was one of their good bread-and-butter plays they wanted to go to, and the kid stepped right in front of it. He was in the right place.\" \n",
      "Bevino credited the Lions' defensive coaches with catching that play, which the Whalers (1-4) ran to score against Ledyard. \n",
      "\"I thought we played well tonight,\" Bevino said. \"I don't think it had anything to do with how good or how bad they are. They're big. They're physical.\" \n",
      "New London didn't have an answer for the Lions often, though. Brett Huber was involved in five touchdowns: The junior ran for the first, caught three and threw for another. R.J. Balado ran for 122 yards on 21 carries and both caught and ran for a score. \n",
      "\"We just have playmakers all over the field,\" Huber said. \n",
      "Quarterback Lance DiNatale 's first three passes fell incomplete. He finished 12-for-19 for 245 yards and five touchdowns. \n",
      "Foran scored 50 points for the second week in a row and the third time in four games. \n",
      "\"We were clicking on all cylinders,\" Bevino said. \n",
      "\"The offensive line played phenomenal today. Lance had all day to throw the ball. ... He's getting better every week, every single week.\" \n",
      "The Lions' second drive took 13 plays and scored on the first play of the second quarter, a 19-yard score from DiNatale to Colin Firmender to make it 12-0. \n",
      "Zach Cleary 's squib kick hit a couple of Whalers before Foran's Matt Cruz jumped on top of it at the Whalers 34. On the first play, Huber hit Firmender for another score 10 seconds after his first. \n",
      "\"We practiced that one all week,\" Huber said. \"We practiced it many times. I was just afraid I was going to underthrow him, and that was it. He made a great catch and a great effort to get in.\" \n",
      "Foran's defense settled in nicely after that first drive. New London didn't earn another first down until 7:14 remained in the second quarter and the Lions had their 33-0 lead. Jordan Townsend sacked Gomez three times. \n",
      "The easy win kept the Lions undefeated for next Friday's homecoming game against West Haven (3-2). \n",
      "\"It's great. I can't wait for next week, coming in, West Haven, 5-0,\" Lynch said. \"It's going to be a great game, a great team we're going up against.\" \n",

      "Like all football teams, the goal for Elmira High School is to score on each of its possessions and stop the opposing offense every time. \n",
      "Unlike most teams, though, the unbeaten Express has been nearly able to achieve that goal over the last month of the season. \n",
      "The domination continued Saturday afternoon at Mary Harrigan Field, with Elmira building a 40-0 lead by halftime in a 55-14 victory over a visiting Corning team that came in riding a four-game winning streak. The 55 points were one more than Elmira’s Section 4-best season average. \n",
      "The Express, ranked 21st in Class AA by the New York State Sportswriters Association, clinched its third straight Section 4 Football Conference, Division I title and the top seed for the Section 4 Class AA semifinals. Elmira (6-0, 3-0 Division I) will be at home for its semifinal. \n",
      "“Any time you play a league game, you want to come out a little hungry, play with some edge, play like they want to prove something,” Elmira head coach Jimmy McCauley said. “I thought we did. \n",
      "“We came out and took care of the ball offensively. Defensively, I thought we did some good things as far as making some stops when we needed to, and special teams is consistent.” \n",
      "Senior wingback Dashaun Sutton ran 10 times for 202 yards for Elmira and scored four touchdowns, the shortest of which was a 20-yard reception of an Anthony Aumick fourth-down throw that made it a 14-0 game less than four minutes into play. \n",
      "Allaah Sessions added 146 yards and a touchdown on just seven attempts. Elmira finished with a 489-228 advantage in total offense after outgaining the Hawks (4-2, 2-1 Division I) by a 321-96 margin in the first half. \n",
      "“The whole team did a good job,” junior defensive lineman Reece Harriel said. “The offensive line, good blocking; the defense, flowing to the ball.

      "Elmira has outscored its last four opponents 247-28 and the offense has been close to unstoppable. The Express has averaged 43 points over the first half of its last five games, starting with a 44-43 win against Binghamton. Elmira averages 9.4 yards per rush attempt. \n",
      "“They’re a run-based team that’s able to explode for big plays and we couldn’t stop them from doing that,” Corning head coach George Bacalles said. “That’s something obviously that needs to be fixed. I’ll take this one – my responsibility.” \n",
      "Said McCauley of Sutton and Sessions: “It’s a perfect combination when you’ve got guys who have God-given talent, then you put in a little hard work. Those guys put an enormous amount of hours in the weight room, they spend a lot of time (watching film) just trying to get any edge they can.” \n",
      "As tough as Sutton and Sessions are in Elmira’s double-wing attack, the offensive line has been a force as well. That group includes tight ends Christian Meagher and Dan Fedor, center Zane Tucker, guards Matt Burge and Josh Noonan, and tackles Robert Harriel and Cole Berry. \n",
      "“They’re working hard in the weight room and they’re doing their job,” Sutton said. “They contribute. That’s what makes our offense so hard to stop.” \n",
      "Devon Sullivan ran for 92 yards and two touchdowns on 19 carries for Corning. The first touchdown didn’t come until 45 seconds remained in the third quarter, with the Hawks down 48-0 at that point. \n",
      "“Obviously, the better team today won,” said Bacalles, whose team beat Elmira in last year’s Class AA sectional final after losing 30-0 to the Express in the regular season. “They came right out and executed from the get-go on offense, defense and special teams. I thought Elmira played phenomenal.” \n",
      "Sutton scored on a 42-yard run on Elmira’s second play from scrimmage, then set up his 20-yard touchdown catch on fourth-and-7 with an interception that he returned 17 yards to Corning’s 23-yard line. \n",
      "Corning moved the ball inside Elmira’s 30-yard line on its next drive, but a holding penalty helped derail that series. Two plays after a punt, Sutton bolted up the middle for an 84-yard run that made it 22-0. \n",
      "Elmira pinned Corning at its own 2-yard line on the ensuing kickoff and Sessions tackled Sullivan in the end zone for a safety on second down from the 1. Two plays after the free kick, Sessions took off for a 52-yard touchdown run and Elmira’s lead was 32-0 less than a minute into the second quarter. \n",
      "Airihk Ashley added a 21-yard touchdown run in the final minute of the first half, with Sutton scoring from 38 yards away on the starters’ only drive of the second half. Deonte Jones contributed a 1-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter and finished with 65 yards on six rushes. \n",
      "The Corning offense came in averaging 42 points since a 54-7 loss to four-time defending state champion Maine-Endwell to start the season. Many of those points came courtesy of Sullivan, who had 14 touchdowns entering Saturday and a pair of 200-yard rushing days. The Express’ starting defense took away the big plays Sullivan and the rest of Corning’s offense had been producing. \n",
      "\"We were ready for the option. The option we focused on this whole week,\" Harriel said. “We had a lot of pressure up front. That’s all we’ve been working on the whole week is getting to the quarterback and finding the ball. Everybody gets hit every play. That’s what we do.” \n",

      "LSU coach Les Miles leads the Tigers onto the field prior to kickoff against Florida on Oct. 17. (Photo: Crystal LoGiudice, USA TODAY Spor)\n",
      "1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The idea of a College Football Playoff Eliminator is that with only 3% of FBS teams able to make the Playoff, the herd has to be thinned. And it's not all going to be thinned on Dec. 6, when the Playoff selection committee announces its Football Four.\n",
      "Last year the eliminator policy was simple: Lose to a Group of Five team, and you're not making the Playoff. Lose twice to a Power Five team, and you're not making the Playoff.\n",
      "This year, I am changing the rubric to factor Playoff selection committee behavior and a metric I have been using to track college and pro football efficiency for nearly a decade.\n",
      "How it works Two aspects of college football have defined the past 15 national champions and last year's four inaugural Playoff teams. Talent and scoring efficiency. Every national champion started the season as a top 10 team in CFBMatrix talent rankings and ended the regular season with a top three rank in offense and/or defense scoring efficiency.\n",
      "Follow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. This is a long-term view, as each week team will slide in and out of the top two tiers. But by selection Sunday, I expect the process to sift out the non-contenders and leave us with the four teams the committee ultimately chooses to move to the semifinals. The only part of this process that may need to be retraced is the two-loss-and-you're-out qualifier as a two-loss LSU team won the title several years back.\n",
      "OK, Group of Five teams, you are all out. As long as the selection committee has strength of schedule to consider, you don't have a chance. You do will not have enough quality wins, and your physicality index is too low. Marshall was undefeated in the first committee rankings of 2014 and couldn't crack the top 20. Yes, a team will get into a New Year's Six bowl that the opposition will not practice for and few will watch. But that is as good as it gets. If you believe in the need to factor SOS in your Playoff field, this is the only way.\n",
      "Each week I take the overall list of contenders and divide it into three tiers. This shifts every week, as it is based on my Scoring Efficiency Metric Chart. Every national champion the past 10 years has ranked in the top three in offense or defense. Every 2014 Playoff team was top 25 in total scoring efficiency, and all but Florida State were top 10.\n",
      "FIRST FOUR IN LSU, Utah, Baylor, Ohio State.\n",
      "FIRST FOUR OUT Florida State, TCU, Clemson, Michigan State.\n",
      "TIER I — National champion pool Teams that are top 3 in offense or defense scoring efficiency:\n",
      "Baylor: No. 1 offense, No. 1 overall scoring efficiency\n",
      "TCU: No. 2 offense, No. 9 overall scoring efficiency\n",
      "TIER II — Playoff contenders Power Five teams that are top 25 in overall scoring efficiency but not top 3 in either offense or defense (in order of rank):\n",
      "Ohio State, Florida State, Iowa, Utah.\n",
      "TIER III — The rest All other Power Five programs with with zero or one loss, but that are not top 25 in total scoring efficiency:\n",
      "California, Duke, Pittsburgh, Penn State, Michigan State, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Clemson, LSU, Duke, North Carolina, Stanford, Alabama, Notre Dame, Florida.\n",

      "It’s typically by the midway point of college football’s regular season that the nation’s best teams have separated themselves from the pack. The same could be said of the nation’s best individual performers. \n",
      "The USA TODAY Sports Midseason All-America team recognizes the group of players from Power Five and Group of Five conferences who have excelled through the first seven weeks of the season. The team includes 25 players: 11 on offense, 11 on defense and three specialists. \n",
      "It’s a list paced by LSU running back Leonard Fournette and TCU quarterback Trevone Boykin, the perceived frontrunners for this year’s Heisman Trophy. Boykin is one of three offensive skill players from the offense-first Big 12 Conference, joining teammate Josh Doctson and Baylor’s Corey Coleman. \n",
      "Baylor leads all teams with three selections, with Coleman joined by offensive tackle Spencer Drango and defensive tackle Andrew Billings. Another six teams have two picks: TCU, LSU, Stanford, Alabama, Texas A&M and Utah. \n",
